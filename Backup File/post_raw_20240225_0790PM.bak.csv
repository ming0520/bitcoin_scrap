17;"1ax1tto";"Query";"Not sure if im commenting in the write section here, I dont usually use reddit. Apologies if so. Ive been holding btc for a few years now, playing the long haul but recently I did a swing trade and that trade happened to be right at the beginning of the recent heavy bull market. So I sold out at 43500, and now obviously I watch anxiously for it to drop back down somewhere near my exit point to quickly buy back into the market and once again be apart of the cash cow. But the anxiety of this not happening and it flying upwards again (which we know it will at some point) is becoming too much. I think about it way too much and I'm wondering if maybe I should just cut my losses and buy back in with a 1k profit loss or if were going to have a pre halving bear market giving me my opportunity. Disclaimer, I know ultimately no one can say for sure, but my knowledge is actually very limited, and any thoughts would be very helpfull :)";"2024-02-22 16:51:03.000000";"2024-02-22 10:08:10.375989";"Reddit";"/r/Bitcoin/comments/1ax1tto/query/";"Ynysion";"80ph8le5";3
18;"1ax0xty";"51% attack soon? ";"Apple just changed the encryption in iMessage to prevent against quantum computing(no longer SHA 256)… this is much earlier than I thought… talks of quantum computing seems to be futuristic, yet Apple just took a preventative step!!! 

My question:
Can the bitcoin, net work adapt a new algorithm (the same way Apple just did) as a preventative measure to enhance security in order to prevent a 51% attack for mining?

I’m not really worried about quantum computing, guessing private keys I’m more worried about quantum computing being used for 51% attack.
 
I’m aware that if SHA 256 is hacked, much more is at risk in this world than bitcoin…

I just want to know what the road map would look like for upgrading the Bitcoin network to something stronger than SHA 256
